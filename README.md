## 🙌 Project Personal Milestones

- **S**uccessfully created a scene, objects, colliders and materials for the first time
- Learned what a prefab is and and their applications significantly improving my workflow efficiency
- Added pattered terrain and trees by using brushes
- Got familiar with menus, setup processes, navigation tools, zoom functionality, and overall workflow
- Added restrictions, actions and commands by adding simple C# scripts

## 💡 Inspiration for creating this project

The games shown above were build during a three-day 'Introduction to Unity' workshop during the 2025 annual congress of my major.

Many thanks to Luis Roberto Ramos, workshop’s instructor, for giving me the tools and being very patient with me while teaching. 

## 👀 About the project

### HoneyBalls

*Honey, Gotta Catch 'Em All!*

- Players must catch all 'Honey Balls' while avoiding falling off the edge of the plane.
- Developed collision detection and player movement using C# scripts.

### TheWorld

*Conquer the highest hill of a Minecraft patterned world*

- Exploration-focused gameplay set in a Minecraft-inspired terrain. Players can climb hills while avoiding pitfalls at the edges of the map.
- Boosted player experience by adding a first-person camera perspective using a custom script.
